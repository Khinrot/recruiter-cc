# Introduction
This is a simple repo with a list of recruiters who spam you with unwanted unsolicited jobs adverts. If you're like me, you're sick of having these shoved down your throat. This has inspired me to create this fun (really fun!) game. I hope you all take part in the game, and also contribute to the list.



# Recruiter CC - The Game
1. When you receive unsolicited spam (job advert) from a recruiter, hit reply. 
2. CC the entire list of recruiters listed in this repo.
3. Type "Please take me off your Recruitment BCC list".
4. Click send.
5. Grin.


## Why?
Just cos. Plus, my hope is that we can destroy this fucking shonky practice, by hitting back. Each spam they send, will cause spam to their colleagues and rival companies.

In the words of drcongo:
What to do if you find your company on this list? Stop shitting in the inboxes of busy people. Leave and go work for a company with some ethics.
